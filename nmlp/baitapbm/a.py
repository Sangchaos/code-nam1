# Let's try to perform a basic edit which involves replacing the hair with a simple colored area
# that matches the background. This is a rudimentary form of the request and won't look natural,
# but it will give an idea of the hair being "removed" in a very basic sense.

    # Define the area where the hair is, this would normally be done with more complex
    # image processing, but for this example, we'll use a fixed area
    # This is a rough estimation and would not be accurate without proper coordinates
